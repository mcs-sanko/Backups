- MSRs solve the fluid dynamics problems due to no boiling in the core.
- MSRs solve the online refueling problem due to liquid fuel.
- We need to solve the corrosion problems, think of suitable ceramics. Ceramics are brittle so think about ceramic coatings only.
- Can use heat directly in thermochemical hydrogen production or desalination plants. (Buharlaştırılmış suyun elektrolizi daha veirmli diyorlar, really, how much)
- Thorium fuel doesnt need enrichment
