| **1. Design Thinking to Choose What to Create**           | **Discovery & Validation**                        | This is the crucial stage of achieving **Problem-Solution Fit**. It's the process of ensuring you've correctly identified a painful problem before building anything.                               |
| **2. Bootstrap & MVP**                                    | **Proof of Concept (PoC) & Pre-Seed/Seed Stage**  | This is about achieving **Technical Feasibility** and **Founders' Validation**. The MVP is the tangible asset you use to raise initial capital.                                                     |
| **3. First Dilution, Scale Up a Bit More, Start Selling** | **Seed Stage Funding & Product-Market Fit (PMF)** | This is the most critical inflection point. The money raised is used to prove that your product is something customers **need** and **will pay for**—the definition of **Product-Market Fit**.      |
| **4. Full Team & Scaling**                                | **Series A / Growth Stage**                       | This is where you focus on **Scaling Execution**. You move from _finding_ a repeatable business model (PMF) to _executing_ that model rapidly and consistently across new markets or product lines. |

## Your Framework Re-stated for a Classical Business
If you were establishing a classical business (e.g., a high-end restaurant, a regional manufacturing shop, or a consulting firm), your four steps would be adjusted as follows:
1. **Idea & Validation:** Define the **local market gap**, find a **prime physical location**, and create a **detailed Business Plan** to secure financing.
2. **Bootstrap & Product:** Secure a **bank loan**, acquire **physical assets/inventory**, and launch a **fully operational Version 1** with the necessary licenses/permits.
3. **Profitability & Stability:** **Achieve Breakeven** and establish a consistent, positive **cash flow**. Hire **operational staff** as needed to maintain service quality.
4. **Scaling & Maturity:** **Reinvest profits** to expand (e.g., open a second location, buy new equipment) with a focus on **long-term sustainability** and maintaining high profit margins.
