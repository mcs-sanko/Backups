- Big companies will invest in or acquire early bird startups of the current trends regardless of how they will perform in the future. Minimizing the risk of being left behind is much more important than holding onto money for these big firms, because being left behind is the only way these huge companies collapse. (If microsoft dominates web search with openAI than it can kill Google as simple as that) And since big firms move very slowly they invest in much more dynamic startups to fund and be a part of breakthrough technologies. You can use this principle to make an exit with your company.
