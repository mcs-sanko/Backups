- **Time**
	- No one is going to value you more than you are. You MUST value your time above all else. You must give yourself an hourly rate and see if taking a one hour commute is worth for the discount. Pick that number absurdly high! If it is not absurd to you, it is not high enough. Now whenever you are using your time on anything but your hustle deduct yourself at that rate. And whenever you are working on your hustle pay yourself at that rate.
	- Ruthlessly dodge meetings. You are literally dying one hour at a time. Make it a walking meeting, a phone call, an email.
	- You need free time and free mind.
- **Internal People**
	- Order of operations: What I should be doing (Emerging market, I have knowledge in it and I want to do it) Surround yourself with the best people (Choose the best alumni network etc. Look at the Paypal mafia they all got absurdly rich) Then you work as hard as you can.
- External People
	- Deal with the smallest firms possible. Bigger firms are usually worse, the principal and the agent are highly separated. So the principal will sell you the service but the agent will probably not care as much.
	- By working with booutiques yes you are betting big on one person or one small group but there are no other throats to choke, the accountability is very high.
