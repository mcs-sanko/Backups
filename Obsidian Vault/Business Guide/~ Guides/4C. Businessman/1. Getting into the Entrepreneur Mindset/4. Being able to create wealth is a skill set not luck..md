- %1 of people are still 80 million people
- Think that in the whole world everybody was working normal jobs
- Except the nation of Turkey
- Imagine that the population of Turkey was overseeing the whole world s trade, production and new business creation
- For that amount of a population you would start thinking these guys are getting lucky and start thinking these guys are teaching each other something we dont know
- And that is precisely what happens

- For these people building a business and developing and selling products is normal and they try to build the best busineess they ll love
- (One of the main differentiators is a perception of solving a problem themselves and selling it as opposed to solve problems for someone else)
