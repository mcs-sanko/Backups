- What should I test first?
	- See if you have a viable problem, solution, market etc. before committing to anything: Run business experiments. (Surveys, interviews etc.)
	- List all your assumptions  about your solution, market, competition etc.
	- Test the most crucial assumption first. (That your whole startup stands upon)
- Then move down your priority list.

- Making sure that you have customers and a viable solution should be repeated as many times as needed before moving forward.
- If you have a very disruptive idea you can implement it before validating since people won’t even know such a thing could exist and it won’t have an existing market. (Chat GPT is such an example, until we had it we didn’t even know we wanted it)
- Build your MVP.
	- That has all the critical aspects of your hypotesis you are trying to test.
	- And only those aspects.
	- Instead of long thinking about every scenario.
	- Put out an MVP get feedback and build on top of it.
	- You will have customer generation inline with feedback and product development.

- Desk Research Some consider it as an experiment methods. We believe it is a good starting point, that may help to get know-how around problem and potential solutions. Desk research gathers and interprets available information from external sources. In other words, you are using search engines, libraries, or other sources of information to discover what others already learned and what is out there relating to your idea. This is very useful to get a general overview of what competitors and alternatives exist related to your idea, of customer behavior towards a problem, and of technologies that can help your idea make possible (or impossible).
- Experiments to validate the problem Customer interview/survey The customer interview/survey is almost always the best way to start. It is THE tool to learn more about certain topics and an easy way to validate assumptions. If we could only recommend one experiment, it would always be to get out of the building and talk to your customers. Your customers have the knowledge, you only have assumptions. Customer Interviews are a tool for you can use in every stages of your company, to validate the problem as well as the solution and its evolutions. Picnic in the Graveyard With the picnic in the graveyard experiment you are interviewing founders or team members from failed startups, to learn what they learned in their journey, what they did wrong and why they decided to stop. The most valuable lessons are learned from people who have tried before and failed. Do they have any lessons that you can use to prevent failure?
- Experiments to validate your solution Once you validated that there is an actual problem, it is wise to first test the interest in a solution, before running off and building a solution. We usually do another round of customer interviews first, but after that, there are plenty of alternatives: Landing page A landing page is ideal to test your value proposition and validate interest. There are hundreds of ready-made templates available and lots of services to just easily create a landing page if even a template is too technical for you. What is important when using a landing page is that you ask for some kind of currency. An email address or signup is enough, but people have to ‘pay’ you something to really show their interest. Visitors and pageviews are not enough. Landing page builders: e.g. WordPress; Squarespace
  - Explainer video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4eTR7tci6A&t=2s – Dropbox Example Dropbox got famous with their explainer video MVP. When your product is too complex to easily explain or show a prototype, an explainer video might be ideal. It was hard for the dropbox guys to show the magic of Dropbox before Dropbox existed. With an explainer video and again asking for some kind of currency, they were able to validate the interest in Dropbox. They got overwhelmed with beta signups.
- “Competitor” Usability Testing Competitor usability testing is observing your customers use a competitor’s products or services to gain insights on the mindset of the user, common issues, and potential improvements in your own product. NB: It doesn’t have to the a direct competitior: Paper Prototype The Paper prototype is a way of quickly testing your solution by using paper drawings, flyers or even power point presentations. Mimicking user interaction or the process of the solution to learn if this is what the customer is looking for. NB: Startups get founding just with a power point presentation – (EXAMPLE) Primomiglio sgr
