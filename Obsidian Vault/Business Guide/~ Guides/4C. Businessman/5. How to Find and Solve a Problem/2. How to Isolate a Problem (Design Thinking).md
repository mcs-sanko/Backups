- Your ideas should start from problems or opoortunities not solutions.
- ÇÖZÜMÜN ARKASINDAKİ SORUN DOĞRU TANIMLANMAMAIŞSA O ÇÖZÜM ÇÖP OLUYOR
- Is your product interesting to someone or is it VALUABLE?
- Fırsatların kaynağı nedir
	- Pazar boşluğu (Talep)
	- İhtiyaç
	- Sorunlar
	- Gözlem
	- Farkındalık
	- Vizyon, öngörü
	- Hayal
	- Merak
	- What if?
	- How might we?
	- Keşke şnula ilgili çözüm olsa.
- Look at problems
	- Look at popular, growing markets
	- Look at urgent problems. (Start of the COVID pandemic is a very good example)
	- Look at expensive problems. (That requires billions of dollars. Solve them if they are not solved (C-level consultancy firms were a good example back in the day) or if they are being solved for billions find a way to solve them for cheaper. (Musk sending rockets at one tenth the cost))
	- Look at mandatory problems. (Man’s gotta eat.)
	- Look at frequent problems. (Problems you come across multiple times a day)
- **Don’t start from the solution:** “There is this new tech I want to do something with” <- NO! You won’t be able to drum up a problem. You need the problem, the solution can be anything.
- Selling is helping not convincing -Mark Cuban
- To me individual behaviour is much more logical and understandable then collective behaviour. That s why I dont develop tech for the collective. The upside of this is solving individual problems are harder and solutions are sold for higher price tags. The downside is of course there are less individuals with problems then collective's problems. A great idea should start from an individual's problem but when you try to scale it to the collective it should be the collective's problem too. That is how you know you struck gold with your problem and your solution. Therefore get to know individuals and get to know their problems. Then see of which's solutions are infinitely scalable to the collective. That is your metric of having found the right problem. -MÇS
- Biz yeni bir ihtiyaç yaratmıyoruz. Olan ihtiyaçları karşılamanın daha iyi yollarını bulmaya çalışıyoruz. (İnsanların farkında bile olmadığı ihtiyaçlar)
- 20. Yy normu = Verimlilik (Do the same thing 1x, 2x)
- 21. Yy. normu = Yıkıcılık (BE DISRUPTIVE, do it 10x, 20x)
- Başarılı inovasyonlar ihtiyaçlara çare olur. Fikir düşünmek yerine sorunları fark edin! İnsanların istediğini anlamak bir şey yapmaktan daha zor!!!

---
- Innovation, needs a eureka moment (needs creativity)
- Everything is already invented, you won’t invent anything new (!?). What you can do is improve existing inventions drastically or solve the problem in another way.
- Either business driven (Companies) or tech driven (Academia)
- **Traditional innovation models converge to a solution too fast without giving enough time to the problem and market. You may simply solve a problem that’s not worth solving. -> Use design thinking**
- **Frugal innovation: In especially poor countries people may come up with ideas that work in very constrained environments, with very constrained resources but they simply solve a real problem. Innovation due to necessity and lack of resources.**
- **We usually take the problem for given but today, all the given problems are solved. Right now finding the right problem is actually much much harder. Therefore the real focus shouldn’t be on the solution but the problem. Framing the problem is probably the most critical step.**
- Design thinking starts from human, people who are experiencing a problem. We first find a desirable problem and then see if it is feasible (tech)) and viable (business). (Human centered design)
- What happens in failure is usually not that the tech is not working. It is that the user needs were not understood correctly.
- Innovation is like a gift, you need to think about how it will become a part of the giftee’s life.

- 1. You look at how people are behaving, you listen, you observe, you see what people wish was changed.
- 2. Then you work on the problem, find the problem that’s solving by iterating and reflecting. on the problems
	- Design thinking deals with ill defined problems. (Nature of the problem is ambigious) And reframes it into a pinpointed problem. Reframing is a search and recombination in the problem space.
	- Elevetor is slow -> Make elevator faster (Maybe unfeasible) => Reframe: The wait is annoying. -> Entertain the waiting people.
- Design Thinking
	- Empathize
		- Empatthize with your target customers: Collect info see needs
			- Look at reports, diaries
			- Actually go through their problems. (This is why experiencing a problem ourselves is a historically popular motivator for invention)
			- Look at cultural cues.
	- Needs
		- Explicit needs: Saying chair is comfortable
		- Implicit needs: Things people don’t say but do, by observing
		- Tacit needs: What people test
		- Latent needs: What people dream
	- Define
		- Classify needs (Categorizing them)
			- Delighters, linear satisfiers, baselin expectations
			- ![](Aspose.Words.4646e8ab-39fa-4d13-8ab2-7389db2dcdb6.011.png)
		- Results in a Problem statement  that defines the problem.
			- Root cause of that need
			- What are the needs you are trying to solve
			- What are the constraints working against you
			- Who you are trying to benefit
- Reframing thinking types
	- Abductive thinking: Observe and think of what if
	- Associative thinking: Eureka, similarity, mediation thinking
	- Analogical Reasoning: You extrapolate from a distant source.
- Why do the design thinking?
	- We used to solve problems that signalled themselves for the future
	- Now we should solve problems that will result in a future we want to live in. (Design thinking)
