- **Order of operations for Indie Hacking/Micro Startups and Macrostartups**
	- In macrostartups you are usually paid little to none, you make bank once you do your IPO etc. You make a lot more bank (hence the macro) than microstartups but it is very delayed and stressfull since you barely have money to eat in the mean time. Microstartups on the other hand focus on much smaller market caps and respectable consistent income streams
	- Hence it is much more stress free if you are working on your macrostartup if you already have a microstartup which supplies you with the living expenses along with initiatory experience to the startup ecosystem
- **Indie Hacker (Digital platform or product) -> Entrepreneur: Build liveable stream with microstartups first, then scale up to macrostartups. (Some of your microstartups may scale themselves up to macros if they are good too)**
- Levels of startups: Physical Startup > Digital Startup > Digital Platform > Personal Branding ≥ Content Creator ⊃ Digital Product
- Products are becoming more and more services (Subscription etc.)
