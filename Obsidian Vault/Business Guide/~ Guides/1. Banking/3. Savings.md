## Security = Physical
- Paranin guvenliginden suphe edecegin bir ortam olusursa yani bank run, bankayi kaparlar kasana da ulasamazson. Use a physical vault and physical assets.
- Make sure that you own your stocks in your investment pplatform. (Eğer ki hisselerini başka bir platforma aktar gibi bir özellik varsa bu genelde ownladığın anlamına gelir. Çünkü sen teknik olarak o imzalı hisse kağıtlarının bireysel sahibisin.)

## Cryptocurrency = Only for Overseas Transfer
- ONLY use it to transfer huge amounts of money overseas.
- DONT HOLD! They WILL become hackable, it is not a question of if, it is a question of when
- Also they are not apocalypse proof, and they are susceptible to critical failure against attacks. (No defenders)
- Crypto is just a very big Ponzi scheme and it is still going on.
- Has absolutely no use, same problem with fiat currencies but without ANY DRAWBACK OR REGULATION for dilution or fraud. (You make the inflation 300%, you get a riot, you dilute a ctypto to 1m% nothing happens)
