- Principles of World Powers
	- Rise
		- Win power by defeating the opposition (Old world leader etc.)
		- Consolidate power within country
		- Establish systems and institiutions
		- Choose successors (You cant rise a country in one life time)
	- Peace, Prosperity
		- Strong education, civility, moral – Common Purpose
		- New technologies
		- More productive
		- More competitive in world market
		- More economic output
		- More share in the world trade
		- To protect this prosperity increase military strength
		- Then you use this new found prosperity to feed back into the education, trade and conquest sectors. You do so by using the capitalist approach, by providing entrepreneurs with money using lending, bonds and stocks. This is a strong financial capital system.
		- When you hold this big a share in the world trade your currency becomes widely accepted and it starts being used as a reserve currency. (A currency you can simply print out wwhenever necessary)
	- However since you can and do print more currency your power starts to become a bubble.
		- As you print more money and your salaries go up. A worker in the US becomes less competitive against foreign workers who will do the same job for cheaper.
		- Similarly your tech starts to be copied and start to be produced for cheaper that makes you lesss competitive. The british hired dutch ship designers and produced the ships in the UK resulting in high quality ships for a more competitive price. Same for China today.
		- **GEREKİNCE PARA BASMAYA DAYANMAYAN STABİL, SELF SUFFİCİENT, BUSİNESS LİKE GOVERNED BİR ECONOMİC SYSTEM LAZIM. SWİSS?**
		- Richer countries get deeper into debt by borrowing from countries that save more. (Borrows back dollars since it s the reserve currency)
		- As the empire runs out of its lenders those who have an IOU starts looking to get out instead of getting in by bonds.
		- This couples with the internal wealth inequality gap that widened during the peak of the empire results in internal and external conflicts.
		- The government since it cant pay its IOUs starts to print a lot more money not to default. This results in inflation.
		- To combat inflation governments try increasing the tax and since mostly the rich are now holding the country’s assets these rich people run aay from the country with their money to safer harbors further decreasing the countries income.
		- The rich left behind may get lynched, revolution or a civil war breaks out.
		- Seeing this external powers seek to collapse that empire by attacking etc. Winning this war they get more money and start their own rise.
		- **Principle: EARN MORE THAN YOU SPEND & TREAT EACH OTHER WELL**

- Remarks
	- Trial Consultant: Bull’daki olay. Adam jürinin aynı karakteristiği olan kopyasını üretip onun üzerinden deneme yapıyor. Veya face recognition kullanarak kendini ayarlıyor. Sonuç olarak backgroundda analiz edilemeyini analiz edecek bir tool geliştiriyor.
	- Business magazinelerindeki articlelar ile çok çeşitli yerlerden çok iyi şeyler görüyorsun. Orada okuduklarını gerçek olaylarla ve teorik altyapı ile eşleştirdiğinde ise aslen öğreniyorusun.
	- Burry has a strictly traditional understanding of value. He has said more than once that his investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd’s 1934 book Security Analysis: "All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety."
	- Basic rules of bookkeeping/accounting lazım
	- When a comapny’s accounting is confusing stay away

- Margin of Safety
	- Sticker Price (What they are worth)
	- Margin of safety, a ratio to determine YOUR buy price wrt. The Sticker Price you calculated. %50 margin of safety for a 1000$ stock sticker price means you will buy that stock when it hits 500$.
	- Margin of safety= Difference between intrinsic value (sticker price, ideal value, iits worth) –market price (what it is being sold at the moment.)

	- Margin of safety ile almak demek ileride arttığında daha çok kar veya daha doğrusu ileride o kadar artmasa da zarar etmeyeceğin anlamına gelir. Eğer mos’un %0 olarak alırsan ve düşerse direkt zarar edersin. Ama margin of safety ile almak undervalued almak demek ve beklediğin kadar artmassa bile sonuç olarak kar edersin.
	- Investorun işi undervalued stockları bulmak.
- Asking Questions
