For each one.
Why at that step (after the one before, before the one after):
The goal for at the end of that step.

1. 1 Banking doğrı
2. 2 Investor doğru. Investor before business. Start before business never stop.
3. 3 Business. It goes Employee -> Business. You cant create sector specific know how without getting in the dirt. Holding sahipleri bile çocuklarını o sektörün janitörlüğünden başlatıyor, yes employee is 1
	1. Why be an entreprenur (Ana fikir: Desire wealth and know that it can be achieved through business.)
	2. Entra Mindset (Going into the world you need to have the right mindset to move towards business, wealth and freedom.)
	3. Soft Skills (and these are the skills you will need cultivate in time and everywhere (during your employment while in founder mode etc.) to become a good businessman)
		1. Can be praticed during uni too so this is before employment
		2. 
	4. Use employment to develop your business skills. ==But employee must always be done with the right mindset to serve the right goals. So entra mindset before employee. ==
		1. Employee is a part of business. It is learning know how of the sector, business skills, soft skills, earning money and making friends in high places and to see the needs of your sector. Bu mindsetten sonra olmalı ki doğru amaçla yapılabilsin. (Çocuklarını businessa lawa filan gönderiyorlar çünkü engineeringde çocuk know how öğrenmiycek, sektörün ihtiyaçlarını görmiycek, business skills öğrenemyecek. Biz bu tarafa dallanarak aslında çok doğru bir hamle yaptık.)

- [x] Is freelancer a necessary step where you are subcontracting your jobs so that you can see if you have a business that can survive before taking on full time employees? Is that what stratups and vcs are doing skipping the freelancer step to just hire full time and start organizing like they are not going to fail and when it works it works really well? ✅ 2025-12-02
	- No, a freelancer is just a business that dont need or cant afford any more employees

	1. Goal: Decide what to solve.
	2. Ask aselsan and other companies what kind of a swarm algo they need.
	3. ==You need to at one point quit your job to give yourself the time to develop your business, developing a business from the ground up is a full time job, cant easily be done on the side. Mind you, the worst case is you get another job.==
2. MVP: Bootstrap (Spending your own money) As the founder(s) you use your own time, talent and resources to create an MVP.
	1. The MVP shows that you have the talent to build something good. And with that you can ask for the resources to do so.
	2. Goal: Create your MVP
	3. Show aselsan technical feasability. 1. The tech can be built. 2. The tech can be built by us.

| **Your Framework Step**                                   | **Established Business Terminology**              | **Key Concept/Goal**                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **1. Design Thinking to Choose What to Create**           | **Discovery & Validation**                        | This is the crucial stage of achieving **Problem-Solution Fit**. It's the process of ensuring you've correctly identified a painful problem before building anything.                               |
| **2. Bootstrap & MVP**                                    | **Proof of Concept (PoC) & Pre-Seed/Seed Stage**  | This is about achieving **Technical Feasibility** and **Founders' Validation**. The MVP is the tangible asset you use to raise initial capital.                                                     |
| **3. First Dilution, Scale Up a Bit More, Start Selling** | **Seed Stage Funding & Product-Market Fit (PMF)** | This is the most critical inflection point. The money raised is used to prove that your product is something customers **need** and **will pay for**—the definition of **Product-Market Fit**.      |
| **4. Full Team & Scaling**                                | **Series A / Growth Stage**                       | This is where you focus on **Scaling Execution**. You move from _finding_ a repeatable business model (PMF) to _executing_ that model rapidly and consistently across new markets or product lines. |


## Your Framework Re-stated for a Classical Business
If you were establishing a classical business (e.g., a high-end restaurant, a regional manufacturing shop, or a consulting firm), your four steps would be adjusted as follows:
1. **Idea & Validation:** Define the **local market gap**, find a **prime physical location**, and create a **detailed Business Plan** to secure financing.
2. **Bootstrap & Product:** Secure a **bank loan**, acquire **physical assets/inventory**, and launch a **fully operational Version 1** with the necessary licenses/permits.
3. **Profitability & Stability:** **Achieve Breakeven** and establish a consistent, positive **cash flow**. Hire **operational staff** as needed to maintain service quality.
4. **Scaling & Maturity:** **Reinvest profits** to expand (e.g., open a second location, buy new equipment) with a focus on **long-term sustainability** and maintaining high profit margins.
