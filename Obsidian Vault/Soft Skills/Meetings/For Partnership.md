1. Define the scope of the meeting
2. Meet & Greet. People, names, roles
3. Company introductions
4. Project at hand's summary
5. How we can do business. I am thinking you give us money like this, then we give you money after this etc. Thinking aloud about our business interactions
6. Agree on what the next steps are: Project info sharing, NDA maybe, model sharing / economic variables sharing etc What do you need from us for the technicals (Financial modelling). They said share the model, Yiğpit Bey said no I cant share the model but I can share outr critical assumptions. They said ok. (But note that unless they have a good modeller themselves they will probably just have to take our word)
7. Run hypotheticals, brainstorm about diferent partnership scenarios. ASK THEM TOO
8. Create a rough timeline for cooperation in line with project's timelene. ASK THEM their timelines too! Technical (Financial model based) mutabakat, hukuki mutabakat (term sheet (Letter of intent, key variables), drafts (lawyers negotiate wording) aggreement (binding), contract (due diligence))

Notes:
- We rejected to share APLUS data since APLUS trusted us with their data.
- We even rejected asking APLUS if we could share it just to keep our possible partnership secret.
