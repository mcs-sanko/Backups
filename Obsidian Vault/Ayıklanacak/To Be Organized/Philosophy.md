If I tell you to make 300k a year you will go looking for ways to do it and you may come up with ok I'm going to enter that high paying company, climb the corporate ladder and in maybe 10 years I'll be making that money. But if I tell you to make 1M a year then you will look at the market and will realise that no amount of salary of no positions  pays 1M and you will have to build a business instead and you will see that you wont even have to build a very big business to make a 1M at all.

You can lose money but you cant lose a shred of reputation if you are going to have to raise capital
