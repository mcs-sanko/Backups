This note might be able to replace all of my old philogsophy notes. These are the actual gists.


Independence means that you have such a capital that its passive inccome can finance your lifestyle. 
The only meaningful way to do it is to have a lot of capital.
Which means savings or salaries wont cut it and you have to make a lot of money first.
No salary makes a lot of money you have to build a business first.
Then you can either live comfortably with the business' income after you delegate all responsibilites or you can sell te business and invest the capital to similarly generate a no hands income.

Dipnot: You can technically still gain freedom by just making really good investments over a long time but the first 250k (100k in the 2000s) is a bitch to gain and usually takes the most time after you get your first 250k the snowball effect really becomes real. So it is really useful to create a business to get there faster in the beginning.

Never go into bad debt.
