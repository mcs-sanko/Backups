Instead of saying Good but Bad say Bad but Good to stack the deck in yourr favor. People are wired to focus on what coms after the but. It is complex but it works better than anything you tried before.

After closing say: Who else do you know that would benefit from this?[^1]


Can you give me a discount? Yes sure but you gotta introduce me to three friends that might want my service and we gotta do it right now, then I will give you the discount. Simple, you help me I help you.

Never be reachable directly have a secreteriat that transfers them to a sales person, not to the CEO but to a sales person.

If you are not at 3M a year yer spend 4 hours a day just reminding people you exist.

Reframe your negatives as positives (Small -> Cozy etc.)

If they say it is too expensive. I misjudged the value of the solution to this problem, this must be a small problem for your company, they'l say no no no hold on it is actually really important, well it cant be because you only want to spend 200$. You dont want to make a minor effort for a major goal, do you believe that.

People love saying no, make them buy your product by saying no.

If they say price isnt the issue I dont need it, ask them well if it was free would you take it. Because more often then not price is the issue.
