power brokers: People who has accumulated favors and will play and sell favors for profit

become a power broker.


POWER = FRIENDS THAT WOULD DO STUFF FOR YOU WITHOUT COUNTING THE CHITS. Then you can sell each of these loyal friends' influences against favors and use the favors as you need them

first you find out what they need, then you do it for them then you want something from them

You can power broker your way into anything in life even citizenships or visas

For power you either work people (tit for tat) or punish them (full on war)
Give them what they need and threaten if they don't take it. First friendly than enemy. It is more profitable to have friends. Simple game theory that's why politics runs on tit for tat and not backstabbing



Leave no one of your enemies standing
And taking them down is by exposing their misdeeds and leveraging the law up their asses
