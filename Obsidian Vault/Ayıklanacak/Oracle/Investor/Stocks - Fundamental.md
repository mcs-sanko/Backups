## Insider Stocks Indicator to Buy
- Copy Trading: Palosy, Nicole Malliotakis, Michael Burry, Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings
The idea is to enter a predictable trend before it starts trending.
- Copy Inside Traders. - Tradei yaptıktan 1 ay sonraya kadar disclose ediyormuşlar. O yüzden tradei yaptığındaki fiyata belli bir marjin içinde yakınsa al sadece.
- - Instada sayfalarım var. Burrytracker filan
- Inside trader names in this video too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsrAZ0gnkPo
- Industrial Metals and Energy Commodities/Producer Stocks for Technology Trends
- China just hit 1/10th limit for robotic technicians manufacturing bout to get much better and blue vollar jobs about to plummet.
- NEXT 1000 UNICORNS WILL BE IN GREEN TECH. THEY HAVE TO BE SINCE THE WESTERN WORLD HAS NET 0 GOALS FOR 2030!!!
- AI, Data Storage, Energy!
- Copy Inside Trades that havent appreciated yet:  Palosy, Nicole Malliotakis,  (+any good name with sec filings)
	- Look at trades in the last quarter
	- If the investment size is bigger than %3 of their portfolio size
	- And if they are still holding it
	- And if it didnt appreciate more than 5% yet
	- BUY
	- SELL at +10%

## Forever Stock

s Indicator to Buy
- Bear Market
	- The Buffett Indicator is calculated by dividing the total market capitalization of all publicly traded stocks by the country's GDP (Gross Domestic Product). When the Buffett Indicator is high, it suggests that the stock market may be overvalued relative to the economy, so a bubble burst is more likely.
- US Stocks: They are the only country paying their researchers good money, they will always be creating the best tech.
- Invest only in markets with low inflation, it is pointless if the country is high inflation
- Invest in companies paying excess cashflow. Using the dividend buy more companies that pays increasing (Wrt inflation) cashflow.
	- Buying good companies that pay excess cash
	- Renvesting that cash to buy more companies.
	- Focusing on companies that can increase their dividends over time.
- Don't overdiversify. After 7-10 are good enough to mitigate specific risk. And follow these companies very well.
- Don't buy into bad industries. (Like incredibly complex to manage companies like Boeing, 3M and Boeing) Easy business models.



## Picking A Business
- Filter applied OK: When Long term investing pick sound businesses. Pick business that will be here 20 years from now. Also if they have dividends that's a bonus
- Filter applied OK: Don't buy anything you wouldnt buy for yourself. (I wouldn't buy Apple because their products are completely inferior and overpriced. Don't buy the stock neither, it having a mindless army of followers means nothing, it is a bubble as long as it is a stupid product.)
- Filter applied OK: Look at Good Investors' Big Trades that haven't appreciated yet: Michael Burry, Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett
- Filter applied OK: Reinvesting isteyen businesslar örneğin işte araba rental businessı gibi fiziksel bir şey daha kötü çünkü tamirat yeni araba vs. derken inflated pricetan para harcaması lazım, karını harcaması llazım. Ama software gibi bir şey satıyorsa şirket daha iyi reinvesting istemiyor ve fiyatını rahatçça arttırabilir, pricing powerı varsa yani loyal customerbasei vars a Apple, Dyson gibi yine iyi enflasyondan çok demand kaybetmez,  

- ==When you specialize in one thing when investing you will start finding what the industry is foing and who is actually growing and will keep growing. For example for furniture if you research deeper and deeper you might find the factory that sources and keep sourcing most of the major brands. Now you can easily invest in that factory cause they are building a monopoly==


DEF (9)
- GE Aerospace
- Nvidia
- Meta
- Disney
- Occidental <60
- Chevron <150
- Amazon
- Costco

- Lockheed Martin Alt Yüklenicilerine Bak

IF CHEAP

1. Pick a business & product & sector you understand. https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/industry/sectors/ [Alt](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/indices/sp-sector/consumer-staples?orderBy=peRatioTrailing&orderDir=desc&viewName=fundamental)
	1. Finance -> No unless you understand their philosophy
		1. Blackrock (Subscriptions everything)
		2. Berkshire (Fundamentals)
	2. ~~Healthcare -> No! We don't have private healthcare. It is a topic for revolution, problematic.
	3. Industrials -> Very capital intensive with complex supply chains and business models.
		1. GE Aerospace (Only Jet Engine Maker Left in the Industry) <150
		2. Maybe Northrop and Lockheed
		3. Maybe someone who produces ammunitions?
	4. Infotech -> Parallel to my edge. Look at technologies you understand and like
		1. Nvidia (AI lean undisputed) <90
		5. ~~Bad: Microsoft (Bad product), Apple (Bad product), Tesla (Bad product quality), Reddit (Going downhill due to greedy management)
	5. Materials -> I don't understand it yet, understand it and buy the material producers for the trending producers. (Lithium producer if the battery company it is supplying is taking off)
	6. ~~Real Estate -> No, bilinçsiz çok fazla kişi bu sektörde (Herkes), toplu hatalara çok açık 2008'deki gibi.
	7. Communication -> Only 3 stocks I am familiar with in the sector
		1. Meta (Undisputed marketing and user retention platforms)
		2. Disney (They will always have customers: Kids, Marvel fans, Star Wars fans)
		3. ~~Google (AI can wipe them out)
	8. ~~Utilities -> Energy is better than Utilities
	9. Energy -> Follow Buffet, really good potential with the upcoming AI, wars and population increase
		1. Occidental <60
		2. Chevron <150
	10. Consumer Discretionary -> Only for things I would definitelt buy for myself otherwise most of these produce overpriced bad quality prıoducts.
		1. Amazon (Monopoly) <100
	11. Consumer Staples -> This is a non-negotiable sector, very good in times of turmoil. Needs simple supply chains otherwise easy to make mistakes. , Food, Beverage, Retail ~~Household Consumables, Tobacco, Personal Care (These are produced unhealthily doomed to fail.)
		1. Costco (Complex but the undisputed king of retail with inventory turnover > 12)
		2. ~~I dont use them, I dont know Cola, Pepsi, Dr Pepper, Heinz <33
4. Look at the fundamentals to be good. Because you will hold the stocks for dividends it is more important that they have good fundamentals and will grow their dividends in time. (This results in both stock appreciation and dividend appreciation in 10 years.)
	1. Dont look at just the starting dividend yields look at other performance data. (It's a trap, like verizon or at&t. This results in stock depreciation and net dividend to lose against inflation in 10 years)
	2. Look at dividend growth instead. (Mastercard, Roadhouse etc.) 
	3. Look at revenure growth.
	4. Look at free cash flow growth.(The dividend follows the cash growth)
	5.  Look at EPS (Earnings per share)
	6. Look at cash and debt. (They should have cash>>debt)
	7. Not capital intensive or overly complex companies. - Go for a business any idiot can run because sooner or later any idiot is probably going to run it.
5. Buy them at a fundamental discount (Peter Lynch Screener)
	- PEG R<1 (Büyüme oranına kıyasla ucuz mu)
	- Sales>500
	- P/E<25 (Price/Earnings)
	- Profit Growth >20
	- Debt to Equity < 0.2 (Borç/Özsermaye)
	- Price to Cash Flow > 5
	- Future P/E < 15



### Tax Regime
How to no Capital Gains Tax?? Us stocks nasil??? Ya da fon alcan us stock yerine velhasil altin alip satican pitasadan. Parayı ülkeye sokmak için varlık barışı bekle.

What about capital gains tax? (Menkul Sermaye Gelir Vergisi)
Parayı Türkiye'ye sokarken gelir belli bir seviyeyi geçiyorsa beyan edilmeli. Buna bi work around bul.
