Do it. So worth it.

I have a warehouse where we formulate our own cosmetic products from beginning to end. A lot of companies outsource to co-packers or private label from China, which is very expensive imo. We own all our production machines & equipment. I started out with small manual machines...then semi-manual...now fully automated production lines.

1. Space. This was my biggest mistake. I chose a small warehouse that we grew out of within a year (I signed a 4 year lease). Make sure your location has adequate room for all the machinery you’ll be bringing in. Study OSHA guidelines- there are certification courses you can take online.
    
2. Process. Map everything out on paper from start to finish. Then do a mock up. Then mock up again. Watch the movie “Founder” and you’ll see what I mean. Process is the most important part because you want to utilize your space correctly & be highly efficient so you can make lots of money:)
    
3. Timeline. Understanding the machines & getting into the groove will take time if you’re not mechanically inclined. Hire people that are.
    

I’m a former school teacher with zero experience in running a business, so it was a huge learning curve, but keeping everything in house significantly contributed to us doing well in-spite of the supply chain shut downs all over the globe from covid.

I’m not sure if you follow Paul Akers, but he’s my warehouse guru & I model some of how we run things after his “2 Second Lean” warehouse philosophy. Ton of video resources on YouTube. I make all my staff study his videos so we can all make factory improvements.
