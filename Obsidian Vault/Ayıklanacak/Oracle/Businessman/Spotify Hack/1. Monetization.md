### 1. **Spotify's Revenue Pool**

- **Total Revenue**: Generated from premium subscriptions (e.g., $10/month/user) and ad-supported free users.
    
- **Spotify's Cut**: Retains ~30% for operational costs and profit. The remaining **70% forms the royalty pool**.
    

### 2. **Royalty Pool Allocation**

- **Master Rights (55-70% of the royalty pool)**: Paid to rights holders of the recording (labels or distributors).
    
- **Publishing Rights (15-30%)**: Paid to songwriters/publishers for composition rights. If the artist is also the songwriter, they earn this separately.
    

### 3. **Per-Stream Calculation**

- **Formula**:
    
    Per-Stream Rate=Royalty PoolTotal Streams GloballyPer-Stream Rate=Total Streams GloballyRoyalty Pool​
- **Example**: If the royalty pool is 700Mandthereare350Bstreams,therateis700Mandthereare350Bstreams,therateis0.002/stream. Rates vary by region/subscription tier (premium streams pay more than ad-supported).
    

### 4. **Artist's Share of Streams**

- **Proportional Allocation**: An artist earns a percentage of the royalty pool equal to their share of total streams.  
    _Example_: 1 million streams out of 350B = ~0.000286% of the pool.
    

### 5. **Label/Distributor Cut**

- **Major Label Deal**: Labels typically take 50-85% of master royalties, leaving artists with 15-50%.
    
- **Independent Artist**: Uses a distributor (e.g., DistroKid, TuneCore) that may charge 10-30% fees or a flat annual rate. Artists retain 70-90% after fees.
    

### 6. **Maximum Artist Payout Scenario**

- **Best-Case Assumptions**:
    
    1. Artist is independent, owns master and publishing rights.
        
    2. Uses a low-fee distributor (e.g., 10% fee).
        
    3. All streams are from premium tiers.
        
- **Calculation**:
    
    - Royalty pool: $700M.
        
    - Artist’s streams: 1% of total streams = $7M.
        
    - After distributor fee (10%): **$6.3M** to the artist.
        
    - Publishing royalties (if applicable): Additional 15-30% of the publishing pool.
        

### 7. **Typical Artist Earnings Example**

- **Streams**: 1 million.
    
- **Per-Stream Rate**: $0.003 (average estimate).
    
- **Gross Earnings**: $3,000.
    
- **After Distributor (15% fee)**: **$2,550**.
    
- If signed to a label (50% cut): **$1,500**.
    

### Key Variables Affecting Earnings:

- **User Subscription Type**: Premium streams pay ~3x more than free tiers.
    
- **Geographic Distribution**: Streams in higher-revenue countries (e.g., U.S., UK) yield more.
    
- **Contract Terms**: Exclusive ownership of rights maximizes earnings.
    
- **Publishing Royalties**: Songwriters earn additional royalties if they hold publishing rights.
