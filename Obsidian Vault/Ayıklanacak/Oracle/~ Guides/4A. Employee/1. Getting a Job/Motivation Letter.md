- How do you fit into our specifications?
- Why this position
- Why this company? (CERN)
	- I don’t think people initially think about an organization for engineers when they think about CERN, at least I know I didn’t.
	- I see that an organization like this with a huge campus and population is very open to the development of robotic infrastructure, I don’t know if in house robot development is something that is being considered but I for one would love to explore the idea. (What is the squaremeter and population, land or aviation, food or what?)
	- Laboratory Factory, Town. An experience like no other.
	- Front of scientific development.
	- Development without commercial worries.
	- “Murray Gell-Man in 1961. He is one of the major theoreticians of particle physics, having inrrod uced many of the new ideas into the field. Gell-Mann occupies his excess brain power (a feature common to other theoreticians) with learning several languages, including Swahili, keeping abreast in biology, working on ecology, and advising the government on a variety of subjects.” (E. Segre) Like Murray Gell-Mann I believe the scientists and engineers of CERN like Gell-Mann also use their excess curiosity to learn about other fields. This I believe results in some truly unique characteristics. I would like to think that I am one of these characteristics too and I would love to be a part of an environment so unique.
- What are you curious about?
	- Talk about how they use magnets to direct things and I think that magnets are the future when it comes to mechanical engineering. They are no contact, no friction, beautiful to work with. Also if possible automation in such an environment.
- What is your motivation to want to work there? What is it specifically about this particular role, in this team, within this organisation that makes you excited?"
	- Its all about alignment: Aligning your contributions as a candidate, with the demands of the role; aligning the role's contributions with the needs of the team, and aligning the team's contributions with those of the organisation. If you can understand those three links (and that hopefully also excites you) then you can consider yourself fully prepared to give a great answer.
- What can the company give to you?
	- A taste of the edges of science.
- What can you give to the company?
	- Turkish culture, very unique. Asia origin, middle eastern culture, European living.
	- I don’t think people understand how close to being an art engineering is. I mean many creative people draw superheroes, tech, flying cars etc. without they being considered by engineers. But than an engineer might scope them out an make it a reality.
- Why should they choose me? (Stand Out)
	- Interdisciplinary. When developing an idea I find it invaluable to be able to bounce-off ideas off other people. In order to do this however it really helps if the person across you is speaking the same language. I have been working with electronics and software for years now as part of my robotics passion and this I think qualifies me to contribute to the engineers around that might want to get an opinion of a mechanical engineer. I am caring and curious about any subject.
	- I like doing.
- An envoy of my culture, a multidisciplinary engineer, philosopher, writer, loyal friend.

# Master

## **Paragraph 1: Short, Effective Introduction**
To …,

My name is Mustafa Çağatay Sipahioğlu, I currently study as first-year Master’s for Automation and Control Engineering student in Politecnico di Milano, Italy. I am someone who sees the art in mechanical perfection and looks to the future for inspiration. Consequently, I have been specializing in robotics for the last 9 years as a way to both feed my soul by pursuing perfection and acquiring the tools required to realize my vision for a utopian future. 

## **Paragraph 2 Current Studies, projects, expertise**
- Degree: How your current degree relates to the degree you are applying. Especially important if it seems different than your 
- Subject areas: Show relevant base of knowledge.
- Technical skills similarly.
- Related projects, research expertise.
- Evidence of managing your projects, research slills, application of experimental methodology etc. (Baykar)
- Link Extra curricular interests in my case they are all robotics so it should link right here.

My fascination with robotics began after seeing sumo robots at a science fair when I was in middle school. After ranking in the top 0.1% in Turkey’s national high school entrance exam I opted to enroll in a good high school with a great robotics society. Here I have officially started my robotics journey. After learning a fair amount about robotics, bare-metal control and electronics I’ve led the society and taught to the younger generations before graduating. After ranking in the first 100 (out of 2 million) in our university entrance exam I chose to enter the best mechanical engineering program in Turkey. By opting to pursue mechanical engineering; I’ve learnt about how to design any mechanical, thermal or flow based system with coding optimization programs in MatLab and by running computational simulations in ANSYS and I’ve accumulated the knowledge to build any physical system reliably. Of course I haven’t neglected the electronics and coding aspects of robotics during my Bachelor’s education. I have taken the opportunities I got to learn how to write bare-metal or FreeRTOS code on PIC and ARM based microcontrollers using assembly or C. I have also learnt how to use ROS with Python and C++ by building an autonomous car during my Bachelor’s. And finally, I am currently taking note-worthy classes on machine learning, advanced dynamics and computer aided manufacturing. I also follow an excess second year master’s course on autonomous flying systems which I am able to follow thanks to the master’s level nonlinear control course I completed during my Bachelor’s. All in all, I am making sure that I master every single tool I might need to bring any robotics system I can imagine to life.

## **Paragraph 3: Why this Master’s, What’s in the future, Why this university?**
- What particularly appeals to you in this course/research topic
- Link your plans for future
- Demonstrate that you are making an informed decision by choosing this area. Show genuine motivation. Show that you won’t drop out once it gets though.
- Show that you chose this uni consciously
- Mention particular research groups, people that does what you want to do.
- What you will gain culturally from this application.

Even though I see my mechanical engineering background as a distinct advantage in many cases it also means that I had less exposure to different computing disciplines such as visual computing. By following a Visual Computing & Robotics Master’s Program I hope to remedy this inexperience and equip myself with the principles of advanced robotic vision and control. In the future I hope to work on field robotics using decentralized swarm control for applications such as precision farming, reconnaissance or delivery services. On this road, I expect to encounter the biggest problems in the processing of visual data which I hope to solve preemptively by completing this program. Lastly, I hope to do all these in the ranks of the Imperial College where I see a great academic staff with people like Prof. Andrew Davison along with a strong robotics foundation with institutions such as the Dyson Robotics Lab and the Hamlyn Centre. And finally with a rich multi-cultural environment including many excellent students, I believe that the Imperial College is a great fit for myself.

## **Paragraph 4: Past Work Experience**
- Show that you can fit in in a range of environments and experiences.
- Show your ability to work effectively, successfully.
- Cite relevant skills, or anectodes on overcoming challenges.
- Show transferrable skills.

Despite my age, I’ve been exposed to a variety of work-places already. I’ve got my first work experience in 2019 by working in a robotics startup in Cairo, Egypt as part of the AIESEC GE initiative. Here I’ve learnt how to work with multicultural teams and how to set knowledge baselines and getting on the same page before starting development. In 2021 I’ve interned as a process engineer in Turkish Aerospace Industries where I oversaw a variety of manufacturing plants and learnt how each stroke I take in a design software affects the manufacturing process. Lastly I’ve completed a very intensive R&D internship in Baykar Technologies where I worked as a part of the concept development team designing the next-gen Baykar UAVs. Here I’ve done literature surveys and wrote optimization engines that designed these next-gen aircraft for increased stealth capabilities. During this process I have summarized my survey, reported all my methodology with full references, validated my models and oversaw the testing of the systems I have designed.

## **Paragraph 5: Conclude**
- Summarize interest, skills, experiences.
- Talk how this programme fits in your career path.

My desire for research, application and innovation combined with my love for organizing information and teaching have brought me to the path of academia and I wish to take another step in this direction by conducting graduate studies in the area of systems and control. And I hope to do so by becoming a part of the University of Twente and working alongside like-minded people with minds nothing alike.

Why this program. Kod ağrılıklı olduğu için ve visual expertise robotikte ileri gittikçe en önemli sub alan olarak görüyorum. In a few years by the development of embedded vision chips most of the fundamentals will be abandoned by many people but those who know and follow the fundamentals will have an edge on visual processing. Maybe?

Why this uni? Burs, lol. Onun dışında robotic rare ve tight knit bi grupp. Imperial hem bunu offerlayan hem de çok kaliteli bir network offerlayan one of the few unis. And I believe it is one of the best unis to get initiated into the professional/academic robotics environment.

## Example
To the University of Twente Graduate Admission Authorities,

My name is Mustafa Çağatay Sipahioğlu, I currently study as a senior undergraduate mechanical engineering student in Boğaziçi University, Turkey. (ABET accredited) I am someone who sees art in mechanical perfection and looks to the future for inspiration. Consequently, I have been specializing in robotics for the last 8 years as a way to both fulfil my soul by pursuing excellence and acquiring the tools required to realize my vision for a utopian future.

After ranking in the top 0.1% in Turkey’s high school entrance exam, I opted to enroll in a good high school with a great robotics society. Here I have officially started my robotics journey. I’ve learnt a fair amount about robotics, bare-metal control and electronics, served as the president of the society and taught to the younger generations before graduating. By ranking in the first 100 (out of 2 million) in Turkey’s university entrance exam, I chose to enter the best mechanical engineering program in Turkey. I had seen in high school that although the knowledge of electronics and coding was easier to learn on one’s own, mechanical analyses of robots required relatively special expertise. By opting to pursue mechanical engineering; I’ve learnt how to design any mechanical, thermal or flow based system by coding optimization programs and by running computational simulations in software like ANSYS and I’ve accumulated the knowledge to build any physical system reliably. Of course I haven’t neglected the electronics and coding aspects of robotics during my university education. I have taken the opportunities I got to learn how to code PIC and ARM based microcontrollers using assembly and C. I have also learnt how to use ROS with Python and C++ by building an autonomous car as part of our university’s BURST team. Finally, I am currently teaching myself RTOS systems using FreeRTOS and taking a master’s level non-linear control class to learn advanced control theory. All in all, I am making sure that I master every single tool I might need to bring any robotics system I can imagine to life.

Even though I see my mechanical engineering background as a distinct advantage in many cases, it also means that I had less exposure to the principles of advanced control. By following a Systems & Control (or Robotics) Engineering Master’s Program, I hope to remedy this inexperience and equip myself with the means to successfully work with complex robotic systems. In the future I hope to work on swarm robotics using decentralized control networks and to do so on fixed wing UAVs. To develop such systems, I find myself to be lacking in the principles of swarm control and this is precisely the point I would like to address by following a robotics graduate program in your university. As a result, I hope the avian aspects of such robots to challenge my mechanical engineering skills while the swarm control component to help me gain the relevant artificial intelligence knowledge. I hope to do all these in the ranks of the University of Twente where I can see a great academic establishment with people like Prof. Dr. Ir. Antonio Franchi and Prof. Dr. Ir. Stefano Stramigioli along with a strong robotics foundation with teams such as the famous Aerial-CORE and the Spectors teams. And finally with a rich multi-cultural environment including many excellent students, I believe that the University of Twente is the perfect fit for myself.
