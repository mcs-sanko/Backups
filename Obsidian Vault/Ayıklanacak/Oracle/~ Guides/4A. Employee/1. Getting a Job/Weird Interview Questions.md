When an interviewr asks an unrealistic question they are looking for the following things in your answer rather than an actual solution (A soluton may not exist).

1. Addressing ambiguity
2. Break down the problem
3. Be creative
4. Be smart
5. Communicate your solutino well

But know that brain teasers aren't good for selecting mployees.
