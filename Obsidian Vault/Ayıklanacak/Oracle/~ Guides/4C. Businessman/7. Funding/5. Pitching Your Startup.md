- Tips
	- Use 10-20-30 model:
	- Use 10 slides. No more. Okay maybe two or three more. But that’s it. Slide decks are meant to get another meeting, not close a deal right then and there. You don’t need 20+ slides.
	- Be able to do it in 20 min. So practice and refine it until you can. There’s also almost always an unexpected problem with the projector or something, so that helps with staying on time.
	- Use 30 point font. It makes your content stand out and is easy to read across the room. If you can’t read it across the room, then it’s too small.
	- Make the background black and the text white. It stands out, “looks boss,” and is authoritative.
	- Integrate pictures and humor to help you display a point
