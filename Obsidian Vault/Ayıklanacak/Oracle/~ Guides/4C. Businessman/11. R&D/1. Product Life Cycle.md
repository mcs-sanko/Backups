- “New” Products in the World
	- 10% New to the world
	- 20% New to the firm
	- 26% Addition to existing product line
	- 26% Improvements
	- 7% Repositioning (Such as selling baking powder for its cleaning power))
	- 11% Cost reduced form of the same competing products
- During the design stage very little actual cost (5%) is committed to the project but a good or a bad design drastically changes how much cost will be committed in the long run. (75%) Therefore a good design is very important and should be thought upon carefully.
- People you need to produce your product
	- Research: Using books, articles and any other relevant material they find the necessary information for the development team to use. (Can be the same people in the development team)
	- Development: Produces a technically sound product using research and past experience.
	- Design: Makes sure that the technically sound product is suitable for human use. Thinks of hypothetical cases the user might approach the product, makes everything as intuitive to understand and use.
	- Manufacturing: Creates the physical form of the product. (In case of physical products) (Can be outsourced to workshops and factories)
	- Operations: Coordinates the supply of the manufactured products and the distribution of the sold ones. Coordinates the external team. (Outsourced operations)
	- Marketing: Creates advertisements to make more people want to buy the product. (Can be outsourced to an ad agency)
	- Sales: Actually conducts the transaction where the product is given and the money is taken. (Can be outsourced to retailers or marketplaces like Amazon)
	- Management: Coordinates the internal team.
- Product Life Cycle:

- Steps 1-3 are already finished by using the design thinking method, resulting in a human-based problem and it’s solution.
- Premarket phase
	- 1. Idea generation
		- You can utilize the competitive edge of your core idea:
			- Tech lead
			- Cost lead
			- Customer-based lead
	- 2. Idea evaluation
		- Do a product screening of the possible competition
		- Decide on what your product should achieve and how it will surpass the competition. (If suitable come up with technical target specs that puts your product over others)
		- 1. Concept Design: The specs, what should be researched, initial configuration.
	- 3. Feasibility analysis
	- 4. Technical R&D
		- Hire the necessary help
		- Put in the time
		- Come up with your first design called the minimum viable product. (MVP)
		- The MVP should have all the key components of your solution. Now you can test your product at its infancy and get pre-market feedback to further improve it. (Alpha, beta, gamma… tests)
		- 2. Initial Design: Configuration changes, technical analysis and revisions
	- 5. Product (market) R&D
		- Just as in the design thinking stage using focus groups, observation, interviews etc. test your now functioning product with people.
	- 6. Preliminary production
		- 3. Manufacturing design: The nuts and bolts phase. Decide on how the parts will be manufactured and assembled.
		- Start producing the first samples of your products.
	- 7. Market testing
		- Extensively user test your products.
	- 8. Commercial production
		- Get ready for launch, mass produce your products.
- Market Phase
	- 9.Product introduction
		- Launch of the product
	- 10.Market development
		- Scale your operations, get more and more customers.
	- 11.Rapid growth
	- 12.Competitive market
	- 13.Maturity
	- 14.Decline
	- 15. Abandonment
