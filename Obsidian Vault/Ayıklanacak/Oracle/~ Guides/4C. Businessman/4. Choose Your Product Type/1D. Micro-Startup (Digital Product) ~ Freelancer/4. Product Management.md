- Voice of society: Müşteriyi dinlemek önemli.
- When creating content: There are 2 good motivation sources that will keep you consistent. 1. The content you are going to create is a content you were going to create or wanted to create regardless of if people were going to watch it. 2. You must be obsessed with your content such that you will keep finding new ideas for it. After you have either 1 of these motivators, the only thing left to produce good content is to make each content you produce slightly better than the last one in any sense. (Writing, cinematogtraphy, effects, timing, sound control etc. Note: Find or construct why you are going to be creating that content regardless of if people consume it.
