## Starting a Presentation
- Starting the meeting with the presentation is a mistake. People will listen to anything in anticipation.
- Stories about people, what sacrificies have you made, why is this topic important you, in your business how do you affect quality life of the customer. The listener should connect to you not the product, you give the technical details anyways, if the audience can trust you, engage with you then they will want to hear what yoou got to say.

## Talking
- Normal times: Deep and relaxed tone when speaking
- Speak with a constant volume of 7/10 because it will be clearer.
