- Money without free time is worthless, free time without money is pointless. Rich is measured in dollars, wealth is measured in time.
- Wealth is businesses that can earn you money while you sleep. Purpose of wealth is freedom. Money is how you transfer wealth.
- Focus all your abilities on obtaining asset, never let go of your assets. Assets: Business that doesn't require your attention, stocks, bonds, real estate, IOUs, royalties (art, patents etc.) focus on building your business not your profession.
- You need to create wealth from ideas, technology and art.
- You can create wealth with limited risk. **We’re genetically wired to be a pessimist. But now world is safer, you can just play with an investor’s money. So you need to take some risk because you can have unlimited upside.**
