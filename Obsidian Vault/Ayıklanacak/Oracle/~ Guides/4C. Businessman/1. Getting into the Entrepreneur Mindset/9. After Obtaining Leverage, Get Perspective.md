- You have a lot more risk and more to gain. You have gone from steering a sailboat to an ocean liner. Gotta slow down and get some judgement.
- If your judgement is **demonstrated** and credible (like Warren Buffet) people will literally throw money at you to manage. Because at a %10 better judgement than the next guy the compounding effect will be giant when millions are given to you to manage.
- Judgement: Knowing the long term consequences of your actions and using them.
- Best judgement is given without emotions. Emotions must not blind you.
- **You are accountable for your judgement. Judgement is the exercise of wisdom. Wisdom comes from experience. Experience can be accelerated through rapid iterations.**
- What you need is studying everything. Becoming a philosopher. Becoming stoic. This way you won’t manage anything on emotions.
