- I've always wanted to build my own company and my own inventions
- It wasn't until I started interning in some of the biggest ME companies in Turkey I started having the heart for it
- Firstly I saw that even the works I expected to be the most rewarding become monotonous after just 1-2 years
- let alone the whole 30 years you are expected to work there
- I had already started a mentoring program thanks to TEV
- which was helping me build a roadmap in my mind, how to start a firm, how to manage it, who to do it with
- I ve talked with engineers in these big firms that people having entrepreneural thoughts were working on their projects on the side
- but I saw in my mentoring program and with some chats I had with our school's technokent enrepreneurs that entreprenuership is a full time job and it should be started as soon as possible
- you could divide your week
- a few ddays you network, look for funding, go over the books
- another few days you develop your technology or market it
- tek olay tabi burda hangi firmayı kurcağını bilmek
