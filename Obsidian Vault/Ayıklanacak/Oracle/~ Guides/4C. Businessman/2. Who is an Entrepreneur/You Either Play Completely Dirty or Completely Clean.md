No such thing as halfway crooks.

Playing clean you create an ecosystem of honest people around you that you can trust and always come to an agreement with. You dont want to lose them they dont want to use you, you just both keep making money carrying each other higher.

	Trade with each other and support each other
	Break every rule
	Are very direct
	Scrappy
