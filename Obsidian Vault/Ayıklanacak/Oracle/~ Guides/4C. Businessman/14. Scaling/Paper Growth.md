Ponzi side of startups.
Oversell your value to rich care-free VCs (Since they are gambling with the investor's money)
These care free VCs tell you to grow faster and faster. Just spend as much money as possible to scale up first and we will think about profit later. This is the essence of startups: Fast growth.
The thing is a startup can grow fast as long as it has money to burn through.
Your first VC talks to their other VC friends and shows your growth charts (The idea and the foundation might be completely rotten but as long as you have used the Series A round to show growth by even purely burning cash you have shown groth.)
So the other VC friends see this growth and want to do the Series B, now you take more money and they want to see even ore growth. Then it goes C, D, E etc. etc.
And since the valuation of your company is whatever the VC thinks it should be, you will have a higher and higher valuation as you get funding and your rotten founded cash furnace will be seen as a very valuable company in the market.
The last piece of the puzzle is after VCs inflate your value more and more after they take you public they get their return on investment by dumping your shit stock to the public.
This only works as long as money keeps coming in. But the money never stops as long as these utterly idiotic VCs keep making money by dumping the stocks on to the public or selling the startup to big tech.
This is called paper growth not real growth.
