- Your money is always more safe in your more nobler hands than in the governments. A government will never use that money to help someone on the street
- For the government all taxes are like pennies on a dollar, they don't need to outright take your money in order to finance themselves, they can just print the money they need at the expense of devaluing your money. And they as a matter of fact precisely do this, then why do we need to pay taxes? To keep up the illusion that we are funding the government. (Well we are funding the government but they don't ask as like they do for taxes, they just pulll the value of the money right from our pockets.)
