How long market assumptions usually hold for, it is illogical to compare projects at a longer horizon as much can change over that horizon

# Short methodological note (how to interpret / why numbers differ across countries)

- **Regulated sectors (utilities, water, electric)** get the **longest T** in developed markets where regulatory frameworks and depreciation schedules create multi-decade effective stability (CEER, national regulatory frameworks). In China utilities also show long horizons but more subject to policy shifts; in Turkey regulatory frameworks exist but political/regulatory risk is higher → slightly shorter ranges. [Ceer+1](https://www.ceer.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GA191_05_2_IRB-Regulatory-Frameworks-Report-2024-Main-report-1-1.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Commodity/materials/steel**: use commodity-cycle evidence (BIS/World Bank) plus country industrial-policy persistence for China (longer T for Chinese steel due to state intervention), shorter in Turkey where market forces and cyclical volatility dominate. [bis.org+1](https://www.bis.org/events/ccacloseconf2016/introduction.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **PPAs / renewable energy**: contract lengths (PPAs, FITs) anchor longer practical horizons (typically 10–25 years), so renewables/IPP T values reflect that. [epa.gov+1](https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/customer-power-purchase-agreements?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Defense / Aerospace**: long procurement & platform life cycles (often 10–30+ years) and strong state dependence produce long TTT, especially in the U.S. and China. [Wikipedia+1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_F-35_Lightning_II_procurement?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
- **Technology, consumer discretionary, media, services**: rapid innovation and demand shifts → short T in all countries (3–6 years typically).
    
- **Banking/financials**: regulatory and macro cycles moderate horizon; U.S./EU banking regulation tends to be more stable than frontier markets (Turkey), so T is longer in developed markets.

# How you can use the table (practical suggestions)

1. **Pick T from the range** appropriate to the specifics of the project (size, contract length, degree of government involvement).
    
2. **Document your choice** (e.g., “T = 12 years chosen for Electric Utilities in Turkey because regulator recently adopted a 5-yr control period but asset life is 25 years; political risk reduces expected regime persistence”).
    
3. **Run sensitivity**: show results at T_low, T_mid, T_high (e.g., endpoints) to test robustness.
    
4. **Scenario analysis**: treat T as stochastic (e.g., a survival probability p_stay per year estimated by Markov models) and compute expected dominance over horizon.
