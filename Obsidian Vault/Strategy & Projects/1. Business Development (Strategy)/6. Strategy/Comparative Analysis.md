NPV is the net value of the whole project over its lifetime in cumulative discounted cash flow terms.
IRR is how early you start seeing your returns. It is how head heavy the returns are, is wanted.
To compare projects cut the NPV at a year T. This year T should be a relaively short year that is also predictable. Between two projects you dont want a 50 year project over a 15 year project just because its NPV is higher. Its NPV tends to be higher cause NPV is biased towards scale.
- You want aggressive returns so high IRR. But it wont matter if the scale of the returns (NPV) is low.
- You want big and also agressive returns. Therfore truncate the project horizons at year T i.e. how many years into the future our company is planning. Choose T such that the market and the policies can be reliable. Choose T below the numbers given in [[Comparison Horizon]] for each country so that your predictions until that year can be thought of as reliable.
