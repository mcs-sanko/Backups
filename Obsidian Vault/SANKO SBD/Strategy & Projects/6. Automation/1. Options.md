- Start with Copilot Studio since it is the fastest to deploy.
- Move onto n8n if ownership becomes a valid concern.

| **n8n**                       | Low-code     | ✅ Custom JS/TS, can call Python via HTTP or CLI; Excel via connectors | ⚠️ Medium – needs self-hosting and workflow setup | ✅ Open-source                           | Flexible but slower to implement if you want multi-agent orchestration with memory   |
| **Copilot Studio**            | Low-code     | ⚠️ Limited custom code; Excel natively                                | ✅ Very High – low-code, visual                    | ❌ Managed                               | Fastest implementation, especially for Excel & Microsoft 365 tasks                   |
