# Rejected Because I Would Always Consider Them as Side Hustles and Would Only Do Them Because They Seem Easy to Do, Nothing is Easy to Do
- Game development
- NFT Creation
- Digital Products < Requires recurring effort to make new ones and a completely restart on yur marketing cycle every time. Better to work on 1 product i.e. a service instead.
- Customer products <- Same problem with digital products but now also requiring manfuacturing and distribution etc.
- Influencer, Youtube etc. <- Not doing something really, it is being a creator, being in the limelight and being liked by people. Similar to customer products.
- Faceless influincing <- [Faceless Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHeDsV7diMw)overdone, we dont care for it

Thumbnails
Thumbnail must hold 1 idea to capture the audience in the required attention span.
If they can't understand the thumbnail they won't click it, therefore more than 1 idea is a no no.
Also complicated and detailed thumbnails are also a no no.
At most 2-3 items of focus.

If they like the thumbnail they can read the title.
