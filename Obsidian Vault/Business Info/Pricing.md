Van Westendorp Pricing Model

1. At what price would it be so low that you start to question this product’s quality?
2. At what price do you think this product is starting to be a bargain?
3. At what price does this product begin to seem expensive?
4. At what price is this product too expensive?

==HAVE 1 Price that is well thought of. Always either just that price or free because if you are haggling you are A. Buying a lot of headache down the line B. Signalling that everything you do is open to interpretation.==

Whatever price you decide on the world will believe you once you decide upon it. NEVER forego quality for quantity, simply double your prices any time you run out of products before you run out of customers.
